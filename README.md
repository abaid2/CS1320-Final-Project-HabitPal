## Division of labour

### abaid2
I worked on creating the majority of the backend and frontend functionality for the habit pages, including the calendar input and leaderboard. I also added some additional backend functionality for removal of notifications and friend requests. In addition to this, I also was responsible for styling the majority of the application.

### mdeetman
I worked on setting up the login and register pages with user authentication in the backend. I also created the MongoDB models for the user and habit collections. I also worked on functionality for adding new habits, adding friends, and inviting friends to a habit (although i did not work on the backend implementation of invitations). I also created many of the frontend pages and components although I did not spend time styling them.

### yliang6
I worked on the backend for setting up individual habit pages. I also worked on parts of the invitation feature and habit deletion feature.
