## Division of labour

### mdeetman
I worked on setting up the login and register pages with user authentication in the backend. I also created the MongoDB models for the user and habit collections. I also worked on functionality for adding new habits, adding friends, and inviting friends to a habit (although i did not work on the backend implementation of invitations). I also created many of the frontend pages and components although I did not spend time styling them.
